# Easter Eggs

It's amazing how many references and easter eggs you can find once you start looking around for them. Movie references, jokes, nods to popular culture, memes, secret areas, references to past Holiday Hack Challenge, and funny WebSocket response messages. Below are a few of them, in no particular order.


## Four Calling Birds

This year's [event announcement](https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge/) continues the title trend set by the previous iterations. 2019 was named *KringleCon 2: Turtle Doves*, in 2020 it was *KringleCon 3: French Hens*, and this time around *Four Calling Birds* is a reference to the fourth verse from the [Twelve Days of Christmas](https://www.metrolyrics.com/twelve-days-of-christmas-lyrics-christmas-carols.html) carol.
