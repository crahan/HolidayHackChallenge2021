**Direct link**: [tracer website](https://tracer.kringlecastle.com/)<br/>
**Terminal hint**: [Holiday Hero](../hints/h6.md)


## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Complete the [Shellcode Primer](https://tracer.kringlecastle.com/) in Jack's office. According to the last challenge, what is the secret to KringleCon success? "All of our speakers and organizers, providing the gift of ____, free to the community." Talk to Chimney Scissorsticks in the NetWars area for hints.

??? quote "Ruby Cyster"
    Hey, I'm Ruby Cyster. Don't listen to anything my sister, Ingreta, says about me.<br/>
    So I'm looking at this system, and it has me a little bit worried.<br/>
    If I didn't know better, I'd say someone here is learning how to hack North Pole systems.<br/>
    Who's got that kind of nerve!<br/>
    Anyway, I hear some elf on the other roof knows a bit about this type of thing.


## Hints

??? hint "Shellcode Primer Primer"
    If you run into any shellcode primers at the North Pole, be sure to read the directions and the comments in the shellcode source!

??? hint "Debugging Shellcode"
    Also, troubleshooting shellcode can be difficult. Use the debugger step-by-step feature to watch values.

??? hint "Register Stomping"
    Lastly, be careful not to overwrite any register values you need to reference later on in your shellcode.


## Solution

Solving this challenge is simply a matter of following the instructions to progress through each of the 11 tutorial sections. The last step, writing shellcode which reads [`/var/northpolesecrets.txt`](../artifacts/objectives/o6/northpolesecrets.txt) and prints the contents to `stdout`, provides the answer. To keep the page length to a minimum, all but the final solution are collapsed by default.

??? info "1. Introduction"
    ```assembly linenums="1"
    ; Set up some registers (sorta like variables) with values
    ; In the debugger, look how these change!
    mov rax, 0
    mov rbx, 1
    mov rcx, 2
    mov rdx, 3
    mov rsi, 4
    mov rdi, 5
    mov rbp, 6

    ; Push and pop - watch how the stack changes!
    push 0x12345678
    pop rax

    push 0x1111
    push 0x2222
    push 0x3333
    pop rax
    pop rax
    pop rax

    ; This creates a string and references it in rax - watch the debugger!
    call getstring
    db "Hello World!",0
    getstring:
    pop rax

    ; Finally, return 0x1337
    mov rax, 0x1337
    ret

    ; Right now, we just need to RETurn!

    pop rax

    ; Return from our code, as in previous levels
    ret

    call get_address

    ; This is the literal string 'Hello World', null terminated, as code. Except
    ; it'll crash if it actually tries to run, so we'd better jump over it!

    ; This would be a good place for a label and a pop
    get_address:

    pop rdi  ; pop the string address from the stack into rdi

    ; TODO: Set rsi to the second argument (flags - 0 is fine)
    mov rsi, 0

    ; TODO: Set rdx to the third argument (mode - 0 is also fine)
    mov rdx, 0

    ; Perform the syscall
    syscall

    ; syscall sets rax to the file handle, so to return the file handle we don't
    ; need to do anything else!
    ret
