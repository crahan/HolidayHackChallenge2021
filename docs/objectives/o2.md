## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Help Tangle Coalbox find a wayward elf in the Speaker Unpreparedness room. Talk to Piney Sappington in Santa's courtyard for hints.

??? quote "Tangle Coalbox"
    Hey there, Gumshoe. Tangle Coalbox here again.<br/>
    I've got a real doozy of a case for you this year.<br/>
    Turns out some elves have gone on some misdirected journeys around the globe. It seems that someone is messing with their travel plans.<br/>
    We could sure use your open source intelligence (OSINT) skills to find them.<br/>
    Why dontcha' log into this vintage Cranberry Pi terminal and see if you have what it takes to track them around the globe.<br/>
    If you're having any trouble with it, you might ask Piney Sappington right over there for tips.


## Hints

??? hint "Coordinate Systems"
    Don't forget coordinate systems other than lat/long like [MGRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System) and [what3words](https://what3words.com/).

??? hint "Flask Cookies"
    While Flask cookies can't generally be forged without the secret, they can often be [decoded and read](https://gist.github.com/chriselgee/b9f1861dd9b99a8c1ed30066b25ff80b).


## Solution

At each location you get 3 hints to determine the elf's next location and help filter down the list of possible elves using the game's *InterRink* tool. Hints can either be location keywords which can be used with [what3words](https://what3words.com/), a blurry image from which you can extract GPS coordinates using `exiftool`, or specific elf attributes (e.g., language spoken, preferred social medium, fandom).

!!! note "Cheating by using the cookie data<span id="cookiepella"></span>"
    Alternatively you can decode the Flask cookie data and use the information to bypass all the OSINT research. Start by copying the `Cookiepella` Flask cookie data using your preferred web browser's developer tools.

    Next, create a [CyberChef recipe](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64%28%27A-Za-z0-9-_%27%2Ctrue%29Zlib_Inflate%280%2C0%2C%27Adaptive%27%2Cfalse%2Cfalse%29JSON_Beautify%28%27%2520%2520%2520%2520%27%2Cfalse%29) which Base64 decodes (using a URL safe character set), zlib inflates, and cleans up the data. This will reveal a JSON string containing all the investigation hints, full itinerary, elf attributes, and even the elf's name.

!!! done "Answer"
    Play the game or decode the `Cookiepella` cookie.
