    Woo! I'm Chimney Scissorsticks, and I'm having a great time up here!<br/>
    I've been hanging out with all these NetWars players and *not* worrying about what's going on next door.<br/>
    In fact, I've really been having fun playing with this Holiday Hero terminal. You can use it to generate some jamming holiday tunes that help power Santa's sleigh!<br/>
    It's more fun to play with a friend but I've also heard there's a clever way to enable single player mode.<br/>
    Single player mode? I heard it can be enabled by fiddling with two client-side values, one of which is passed to the server.<br/>
    It's so much more fun and easier with a friend though!<br/>
    Either way, we'd really appreciate your help getting the sleigh all fueled up.<br/>
    Then I can get back to thinking about shellcode...


## Solution

The most fun way to solve this challenge is by teaming up with a friend, but if you want to try out the single player mode that Chimney refers to you'll need to do two things. First, change the `HOHOHO` cookie's `single_player` field to *true* and refresh the web browser window to ensure the updated value is picked up.

Next, create a room (option 2), change the `single_player_mode` variable defined in the [`holidayhero.min.js`](../artifacts/hints/h6/holidayhero.min.js) script to *true* using the web brower's console, and wait for the message stating *"Player 2 (COMPUTER) has joined"* to appear on screen.

That's it! Single player mode is now active. Toggle the switch on the left console to the *ON* position and have fun!

    You did it - rock on! We're all set now that the sleigh is fueled!<br/>
    So hey, let me talk to you a bit about manual exploitation.<br/>
    If you run into any shellcode primers at the North Pole, be sure to read the directions and the comments in the shellcode source!<br/>
    Also, troubleshooting shellcode can be difficult. Use the debugger step-by-step feature to watch values.<br/>
    Lastly, be careful not to overwrite any register values you need to reference later on in your shellcode.<br/>
    That's it! I know you can do it!
