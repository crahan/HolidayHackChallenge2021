    Hi ho, Piney Sappington at your service!<br/>
    Well, honestly, I could use a touch of your services.<br/>
    You see, I've been looking at these documents, and I know someone has tampered with one file.<br/>
    Do you think you could log into this Cranberry Pi and take a look?<br/>
    It has exiftool installed on it, if that helps you at all.<br/>
    I just... Well, I have a feeling that someone at that other conference might have fiddled with things.<br/>
    And, if you help me figure this tampering issue out, I'll give you some hints about OSINT, especially associated with geographic locations!


## Solution

??? abstract "Welcome message"
    ```text
    HELP! That wily Jack Frost modified one of our naughty/nice records, and right 
    before Christmas! Can you help us figure out which one? We've installed exiftool
    for your convenience!

    Filename (including .docx extension) > 
    ```

In the elf's home folder you'll find a series of `.docx` files. We can use `exiftool` to check the `Last Modified By` field in each document's metadata. The document that stands out from the rest is `2021-12-21.docx` because Jack Frost was the last one who changed it instead of Santa. For convenience we pipe the output to `tail -7` to only print the last 7 lines.

Instead of manually checking each file, we can also write a short [Bash script](../tools/hints/h2/find_file.sh) which loops over each file (line 2) and retrieves the `Last Modified By` line from the document's metadata if it doesn't contain the word *santa* ([line 3](https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=exiftool+%24f+%7C+grep+-i+%27last+modified+by%27+%7C+grep+-iv+%27santa%27)). When there's a match, the filename and the `Last Modified By` information are printed (lines 5-6).

!!! example "find_file.sh"
    ```bash linenums="1"
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    for f in $(ls *.docx); do 
        match=$(exiftool $f | grep -i 'last modified by' | grep -iv 'santa')
        if [[ ! -z "$match" ]]; then 
            echo $f;
            echo $match;
        fi
    done
    ```

![Bash script](../img/hints/h2/bash_script.png)

Looking at the file's [revision history](../artifacts/hints/h2/2021-12-21.docx), it appears that Jack Frost added Noxious O. D'or to the top of the *Nice* list!

    Wow, you figured that out in no time! Thanks!<br/>
    I knew they were up to no good.<br/>
    So hey, have you tried the Caramel Santaigo game in this courtyard?<br/>
    Carmen? No, I haven't heard of her.<br/>
    So anyway, some of the hints use obscure coordinate systems like [MGRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System) and even [what3words](https://what3words.com/).<br/>
    In some cases, you might get an image with location info in the metadata. Good thing you know how to see that stuff now!<br/>
    (And they say, for those who *don't* like gameplay, there might be a way to bypass by looking at some flavor of cookie...)<br/>
    Oh, and don't forget to learn about your target elf and filter in the Interrink system!
